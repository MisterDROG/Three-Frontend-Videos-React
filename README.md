Project aimed at young developers. Three Frontend videos are uploaded to the site every day so that junior developers have the opportunity to watch something on the road, at lunch and just in their free time.

Technology:
- React
- Bootstrap
- react-bootstrap

The project is a continuation of my previous project (https://github.com/MisterDROG/Three-Frontend-Videos), which was made only on Bootstrap. This version is fully ported to React and will continue to develop on it.
